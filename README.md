# Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch
Building popular machine learning algorithms from scratch


## Technology Stack 

1. Numpy 
2. Open-CV
3. Pandas

## Why algos from Scratch? 

If you have been involved with Machine Learning for even a month then you know that you can use any ML or DL Algorithm by just importing the scikit-learn library or Keras in less than a minute. However, to fully understand how an algorithm works, it's important to be able to write using just Pandas and Numpy. This is my attempt at doing the same. This is not the most optimal implementation but it is one of the correct ways of implementing these algorithms. This is just for practice and understanding. KD Nuggets writes about [some other benefits](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/05/implement-machine-learning-algorithms-scratch.html) of writing these algorithms from scratch this:- 

* It can help us to understand the inner works of an algorithm
* We could try to implement an algorithm more efficiently
* We can add new features to an algorithm or experiment with different variations of the core idea
* We circumvent licensing issues (e.g., Linux vs. Unix) or platform restrictions
* We want to invent new algorithms or implement algorithms no one has implemented/shared yet
* We are not satisfied with the API and/or we want to integrate it more "naturally" into an existing software library



## Algorithms Implemented So Far
Since this is like a side-project I won't be updating it very often but I have written down some of them. 

### Linear Regression 

### K-Means Clustering 

### K-Nearest Neighbours 

### Single Layer Perceptron
